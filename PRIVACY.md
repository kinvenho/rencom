At Rencom, your privacy is a top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your information when you use the Rencom CLI and API services (collectively, the "Services") designed for collecting, validating, and displaying product reviews for e-commerce stores. By using our Services, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve our Services. The types of information we may collect include:

### Personal Information
When you interact with our Services (e.g., sign up for an account or contact support), we may collect:
- **Name**
- **Email address**
- **Other contact details** you provide

### Product Review Data
Information submitted through the Services, such as:
- Product reviews, ratings, or feedback
- Usernames or identifiers associated with reviews (if provided)

### Usage and Technical Data
Automatically collected data when you use the Services, including:
- API usage logs (e.g., request timestamps, endpoints accessed)
- Analytics data to improve performance (e.g., error rates, response times)

> **Note:** If you are an e-commerce store using Rencom, you may provide customer data (e.g., reviewer details) to the Services. We process this data on your behalf as a data processor, and you are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws for that data.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- **Provide, maintain, and improve** the Services (e.g., process and display product reviews)
- **Respond to your inquiries** or support requests
- **Monitor and analyze usage** to optimize performance and prevent abuse
- **Ensure the security** of our Services
- **Comply with legal obligations**

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. We may share data in the following limited circumstances:

### Service Providers
We use trusted third-party providers (e.g., hosting services, analytics tools) to operate the Services. These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and only process it on our behalf.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose data if required by law, such as to comply with a court order or respond to a government request.

### Business Transfers
If Rencom is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale, your data may be transferred as part of the transaction, but we will notify you and ensure continued protection.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your personal information, subject to applicable laws:

- **Access:** Request a copy of the data we hold about you
- **Correction:** Request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your data at any time
- **Portability:** Request your data in a structured, machine-readable format
- **Opt-Out:** Opt out of non-essential data processing (e.g., analytics), where applicable

To exercise these rights, contact us at **support@renreviews.com**. We will respond within the timeframes required by law (e.g., 30 days under GDPR, 45 days under CCPA).

## 5. Data Security

We follow industry-standard security practices to protect your data, including:

- **Encryption** of data in transit and at rest (where applicable)
- **Regular security assessments** and updates to our infrastructure
- **Access controls** to limit data access to authorized personnel only

Despite our efforts, no system is completely secure. If we detect a data breach, we will notify affected users as required by law.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or meet legal obligations. For example:

- **Account data** is retained while your account is active and deleted upon request or after a period of inactivity (e.g., 12 months)
- **Review data** is retained as long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, unless you request deletion
- **Usage logs** are retained for a limited period (e.g., 90 days) for security and analytics purposes

## 7. International Data Transfers

Rencom operates globally, and your data may be processed in countries outside your jurisdiction, including the United States. We ensure that any data transfers comply with applicable laws, such as GDPR's Standard Contractual Clauses for EU data.

## 8. Third-Party Links and Services

The Services may integrate with third-party platforms (e.g., e-commerce stores). These third parties have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. Review their policies before sharing data.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Our Services are not intended for users under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that a child's data has been collected, we will delete it promptly.
