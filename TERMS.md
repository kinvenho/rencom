# Rencom Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** July 19, 2025

Welcome to Rencom, a Fast API and CLI tool for collecting, validating, and displaying product reviews, provided by RenReviews ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Rencom API, CLI, or related services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "User") and RenReviews, a [Insert Legal Entity, e.g., Delaware corporation] located at [Insert Address or "TBD"]. The Services include the Rencom API, CLI, and any associated software or documentation. By using the Services, you confirm you are of legal age to enter this agreement or have authorization to act on behalf of an entity.

## 2. Open-Source Software

The Rencom codebase is open-source under the MIT License (or [Insert Specific License, if known]). This license governs your use of the Rencom source code, available at [Insert Repository, e.g., GitHub link]. These Terms apply to your use of the Services (e.g., hosted API or CLI), not the open-source code, unless specified. Open-source license terms supersede these Terms only for the source code itself.

## 3. Use of the Services

### 3.1 License to Use
We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Services for collecting, validating, and displaying product reviews, subject to these Terms.

### 3.2 Acceptable Use
You agree to:

- **Use the Services** in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
- **Not abuse, misuse, or disrupt** the Services (e.g., sending excessive requests, attempting to bypass rate limits, or introducing malicious code)
- **Be responsible** for any data you submit or retrieve, ensuring it does not violate third-party rights or applicable laws
- **Not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover** the source code of the Services (except as permitted by the open-source license for the codebase)

### 3.3 Restrictions
You may not:

- Use the Services for **illegal, harmful, or abusive activities**
- **Modify, sell, lease, or distribute** the Services (except as permitted for the open-source code under its license)
- Use **automated methods** (e.g., scraping) to extract data from the Services without permission

## 4. User Data and Content

### Your Content
You retain ownership of any data, reviews, or content you submit to the Services ("User Content"). You represent that you have all necessary rights to submit User Content and grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process, store, and display it as needed to provide the Services.

### Responsibility
You are solely responsible for User Content, including its legality and accuracy. We are not liable for User Content or its use by third parties (e.g., e-commerce platforms integrating with Rencom).

### Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions about the Services, we may use them without restriction or compensation.

## 5. Data Privacy

Our collection, use, and protection of personal data are governed by our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md). You agree to comply with applicable privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when using the Services, especially if submitting customer data on behalf of an e-commerce store.

## 6. Service Availability and Limitations

### At Your Own Risk
The Services are provided **"as is"** without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, except as required by law. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access or error-free operation.

### Limitations
We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., loss of data, profits) arising from your use of the Services, to the extent permitted by law.

## 7. Termination and Suspension

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services at our discretion, with or without notice, for violations of these Terms, including:

- **Abuse or misuse** of the Services
- **Submission of illegal or infringing** User Content
- **Failure to comply** with applicable laws

You may stop using the Services at any time. Upon termination, you must cease using the Services, but open-source code usage remains governed by its license.

## 8. Intellectual Property

### Our IP
The Services, excluding the open-source codebase, are owned by RenReviews and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not use our trademarks or logos without permission.

### Open-Source Code
The Rencom codebase is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE) (or [Insert Specific License]). You may use, modify, and distribute the code as permitted by the license.

## 9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of [Insert Jurisdiction, e.g., Delaware, USA]. Any disputes will be resolved in courts located in [Insert Location, e.g., Wilmington, Delaware], unless otherwise required by law. For EU users, mandatory local laws may apply.

## 10. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms to reflect changes in our Services or legal requirements. We will notify you of material changes via email or within the Services at least **30 days** before they take effect. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
